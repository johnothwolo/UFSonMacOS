Update Dependency Rules:

1) Never point to a structure before it has been initialized (e.g., an inode must be initialized before
a directory entry references it).

2) Never re-use a resource before nullifying all
previous pointers to it (e.g., an inodeâ€™s pointer
to a data block must be nullified before that disk
block may be re-allocated for a new inode).

3) Never reset the old pointer to a live resource
before the new pointer has been set (e.g., when
renaming a file, do not remove the old name for an
inode until after the new name has been written).
